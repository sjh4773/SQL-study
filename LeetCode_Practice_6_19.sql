A country is big if it has an area of bigger than 3 million square km or a population of more than 25 million.

Write a SQL solution to output big countries' name, population and area.

For example, according to the above table, we should output:

+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| name         | population  | area         |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+
| Afghanistan  | 25500100    | 652230       |
| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |

SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 25000000

620. Not Boring Movies

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| id             | int      |
| movie          | varchar  |
| description    | varchar  |
| rating         | float    |
+----------------+----------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the name of a movie, its genre, and its rating.
rating is a 2 decimal places float in the range [0, 10]
 

Write an SQL query to report the movies with an odd-numbered ID and a description that is not "boring".

Return the result table in descending order by rating.

The query result format is in the following example:

 

Cinema table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
| 2  | Science    | fiction     | 8.5    |
| 3  | irish      | boring      | 6.2    |
| 4  | Ice song   | Fantacy     | 8.6    |
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+

Result table:
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| id | movie      | description | rating |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+
| 5  | House card | Interesting | 9.1    |
| 1  | War        | great 3D    | 8.9    |
+----+------------+-------------+--------+

We have three movies with odd-numbered ID: 1, 3, and 5. The movie with ID = 3 is boring so we don't include it in the answer.
*/


SELECT *
FROM Cinema
WHERE id % 2 = 1 -- odd numbered ID
AND description != 'boring'
ORDER BY rating DESC




/*
182. Duplicate Emails

Write a SQL query to find all duplicate emails in a table named Person.

+----+---------+
| Id | Email   |
+----+---------+
| 1  | a@b.com |
| 2  | c@d.com |
| 3  | a@b.com |
+----+---------+
For example, your query should return the following for the above table:

+---------+
| Email   |
+---------+
| a@b.com |
+---------+
Note: All emails are in lowercase.
*/

SELECT email
FROM Person
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1

     LEFT JOIN Address ON Person.PersonId = Address.PersonId
